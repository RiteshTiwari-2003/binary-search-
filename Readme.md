# MINIMIZE MAXIMUM DISTENCE BETWEEN GAS STATION

# problem is that there is array given in wich each number show one gas station and one integer also given like k so how to place k more station in between or outside the station whaich is present in array so maximum distence between two station can be minimum

    for gasStations in range(1, k + 1):
